# defi-dapp


## Summary 
This is a full stack defi staking application for yield farming, borrowing and lending, or any other project you can think of. It allows you to:

- `stakeTokens`: Add any approved token to the farming contract for yeild farming, collateral, or whatever you want to do.
- `unStakeTokens`: Remove your tokens from the contract.
- `getUserTotalValue`: Get the total value that users have supplied based on calculations from the Chainlink Price Feeds. 
- `issueTokens`: Issue a reward to the users staking on your platform!
